Our top priority is taking care of you and helping you feel confident about shopping at Target, and it is our responsibility to protect your information when you shop with us. We didn’t live up to that responsibility, and I am truly sorry. Please know we moved as swiftly as we could to address the problem once it became known, and that we are actively taking steps to respond to your concerns and guard against something like this happening again. Specifically, we have: 1. Closed the access point that the criminals used and removed the malware they left behind. 2. Hired a team of data security experts to investigate how this happened. That effort is ongoing and we are working closely with law enforcement. 3. Communicated that our guests will have zero liability for any fraudulent charges arising from the breach. 4. Offered one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to all Target guests so you can have peace of mind.

By now, you may be aware of a disheartening situation in one of our Philadelphia-area stores this past Thursday, that led to a reprehensible outcome. 

I’m writing this evening to convey three things: 

First, to once again express our deepest apologies to the two men who were arrested with a goal of doing whatever we can to make things right.  Second, to let you know of our plans to investigate the pertinent facts and make any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.  And third, to reassure you that Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling.    

In the coming days, I will be joining our regional vice president, Camille Hymes—who is on the ground in Philadelphia—to speak with partners, customers and community leaders as well as law enforcement.  Most importantly, I hope to meet personally with the two men who were arrested to offer a face-to-face apology.

We have immediately begun a thorough investigation of our practices.  In addition to our own review, we will work with outside experts and community leaders to understand and adopt best practices.  The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks Mission and Values.  Creating an environment that is both safe and welcoming for everyone is paramount for every store.  Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome—the basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong.  Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.  

We also will further train our partners to better know when police assistance is warranted.  Additionally, we will host a company-wide meeting next week to share our learnings, discuss some immediate next steps and underscore our long-standing commitment to treating one another with respect and dignity.  I know our store managers and partners work hard to exceed our customers’ expectations every day—which makes this very poor reflection on our company all the more painful.  

Finally, to our partners who proudly wear the green apron and to customers who come to us for a sense of community every day: You can and should expect more from us.  We will learn from this and be better.

Respectfully,

Kevin Johnson

Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve the current outage of PlayStation Network & Qriocity services. The following email has been sent to all PSN registrants; please read the help and support FAQ for more information.

Valued PlayStation Network/Qriocity Customer:

We have discovered that between April 17 and April 19, 2011, certain PlayStation Network and Qriocity service user account information was compromised in connection with an illegal and unauthorized intrusion into our network. In response to this intrusion, we have:

1) Temporarily turned off PlayStation Network and Qriocity services;

2) Engaged an outside, recognized security firm to conduct a full and complete investigation into what happened; and

3) Quickly taken steps to enhance security and strengthen our network infrastructure by re-building our system to provide you with greater protection of your personal information.

We greatly appreciate your patience, understanding and goodwill as we do whatever it takes to resolve these issues as quickly and efficiently as practicable.

Although we are still investigating the details of this incident, we believe that an unauthorized person has obtained the following information that you provided: name, address (city, state/province, zip or postal code), country, email address, birthdate, PlayStation Network/Qriocity passwords and login and handle/PSN online ID. It is also possible that your profile data, including purchase history and billing address (city, state, zip), and your PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. If you have authorized a sub-account for your dependent, the same data with respect to your dependent may have been obtained. While there is no evidence that credit card data was taken at this time, we cannot rule out the possibility. If you have provided your credit card data through PlayStation Network or Qriocity, to be on the safe side we are advising that your credit card number (excluding security code) and expiration date may also have been obtained.

For your security, we encourage you to be especially aware of email, telephone, and postal mail scams that ask for personal or sensitive information. Sony will not contact you in any way, including by email, asking for your credit card number, social security, tax identification or similar number or other personally identifiable information. If you are asked for this information, you can be confident Sony is not the entity asking. When the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services are fully restored, we strongly recommend that you log on and change your password. Additionally, if you use your PlayStation Network or Qriocity user name or password for other unrelated services or accounts, we strongly recommend that you change them, as well.
To protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant to review your account statements and to monitor your credit or similar types of reports.
We thank you for your patience as we complete our investigation of this incident, and we regret any inconvenience. Our teams are working around the clock on this, and services will be restored as soon as possible. Sony takes information protection very seriously and will continue to work to ensure that additional measures are taken to protect personally identifiable information. Providing quality and secure entertainment services to our customers is our utmost priority.

by now many of you have heard about the

24 hours an interruption of service that
completely took almost every user
offline now firstly let me apologize
profusely for the inconvenience this has
caused and number one of focus to skype
has been first to understand the root
cause of the issue and then to start to
stabilize and bring back up the service
now to do this the way the skype
software works meant that we had to put
in a number of these dedicated super
nodes to actually get the service back
up and running that has taken some time
now to give you a real-time update it's
just about five o'clock UTC 1700 hours
and we're about at 16 and a half million
users back online now for this time of
day that's about eighty percent of where
we would typically be when we look at
current usage from the previous days so
what we're making good progress now what
we've done is we've stabilized the core
services text IM audio and video but to
do this we had to bring in some
dedicated servers and we had to use some
of the servers that we were using for
some of our other services so you're
going to find it's going to take a
little bit longer for us to bring back
offline IM as well as group video chat
because that's where we took the
dedicated servers from to put these
dedicated super nodes in and we know
this has caused a major impact too many
of you and we apologize profusely for
this our focus is to get the service
back up and running understand what we
can do in the future to mitigate some of
these risks and to start communicating
on a very regular basis of where we're
at so expect to see updates from me
over the next few hours as we start to
really understand where we are in the
service and the stabilization hopefully
continues now I know this has been a
very tough 24 hours for many of our
users and there's been so many heartfelt
stories from our loyal customers we
really understand use the service
literally each and every day both in
their life but also in their work and
business environment and no amount of
compensation can really take the place
of that loss the service but we are
investigating right now the ability to
give a credit voucher throughout loyal
paying customers I'll give more updates
in our next update on this and we're
looking into the details as we speak so
stay tuned for more video updates for me

"12",12,"2011","Netflix","","Increase in rental price","Public","Netflix announced an increase in DVDs rental price of 60 percent and publicised its plan to launch Qwikster.",0,0,"0","7/12/2011","9/18/2011","I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation.
It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology. I’ll try to explain how this happened.
For the past five years, my greatest fear at Netflix has been that we wouldn't make the leap from success in DVDs to success in streaming. Most companies that are great at something – like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores – do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business. Eventually these companies realize their error of not focusing enough on the new thing, and then the company fights desperately and hopelessly to recover. Companies rarely die from moving too fast, and they frequently die from moving too slowly.
When Netflix is evolving rapidly, however, I need to be extra-communicative. This is the key thing I got wrong.
In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success. We have done very well for a long time by steadily improving our service, without doing much CEO communication. Inside Netflix I say, “Actions speak louder than words,” and we should just keep improving our service.
But now I see that given the huge changes we have been recently making, I should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both. It wouldn’t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.
So here is what we are doing and why:
Many members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD. DVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.
I also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.
So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently. It’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.
We chose the name Qwikster because it refers to quick delivery. We will keep the name “Netflix” for streaming.
Qwikster will be the same website and DVD service that everyone is used to. It is just a new name, and DVD members will go to qwikster.com to access their DVD queues and choose movies. One improvement we will make at launch is to add a video games upgrade option, similar to our upgrade option for Blu-ray, for those who want to rent Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 games. Members have been asking for video games for many years, and now that DVD by mail has its own team, we are finally getting it done. Other improvements will follow. Another advantage of separate websites is simplicity for our members. Each website will be focused on just one thing (DVDs or streaming) and will be even easier to use. A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated. So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places. Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice-versa.
There are no pricing changes (we’re done with that!). Members who subscribe to both services will have two entries on their credit card statements, one for Qwikster and one for Netflix. The total will be the same as the current charges.
Andy Rendich, who has been working on our DVD service for 12 years, and leading it for the last 4 years, will be the CEO of Qwikster. Andy and I made a short welcome video. (You’ll probably say we should avoid going into movie making after watching it.) We will let you know in a few weeks when the Qwikster.com website is up and ready. It is merely a renamed version of the Netflix DVD website, but with the addition of video games. You won’t have to do anything special if you subscribe to our DVD by mail service.
For me the Netflix red envelope has always been a source of joy. The new envelope is still that distinctive red, but now it will have a Qwikster logo. I know that logo will grow on me over time, but still, it is hard. I imagine it will be the same for many of you. We’ll also return to marketing our DVD by mail service, with its amazing selection, now with the Qwikster brand.
Some members will likely feel that we shouldn’t split the businesses, and that we shouldn’t rename our DVD by mail service. Our view is with this split of the businesses, we will be better at streaming, and we will be better at DVD by mail. It is possible we are moving too fast – it is hard to say. But going forward, Qwikster will continue to run the best DVD by mail service ever, throughout the United States. Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis. The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.
I want to acknowledge and thank our many members that stuck with us, and to apologize again to those members, both current and former, who felt we treated them thoughtlessly.
Both the Qwikster and Netflix teams will work hard to regain your trust. We know it will not be overnight. Actions speak louder than words. But words help people to understand actions.

What’s important for you to know: We have no evidence that your financial information was accessed or compromised. And your password was encrypted. 

If you are a PayPal user, note we have no evidence that this attack affected your PayPal account or any PayPal financial information, which is encrypted and stored on a separate secure network. 

We understand that changing your password may be inconvenient. We are doing everything we can to protect your data. In addition to the security measures we have in place, we are asking you to change your password as a precautionary step. 

If you have more than one eBay account, you should change the password for each account. If you used the same password on any other site, we encourage you to change in on those sites too.

Here are other steps we are taking:

As always, we have strong protections in place for both buyers and sellers in the event of any unauthorized activity on your account.

We are applying additional security to protect our customers.

We are working with law enforcement and leading security experts to aggressively investigate the matter.

We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay. Tay is now offline and we’ll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values./ I want to share what we learned and how we’re taking these lessons forward./ For context, Tay was not the first artificial intelligence application we released into the online social world. In China, our XiaoIce chatbot is being used by some 40 million people, delighting with its stories and conversations. The great experience with XiaoIce led us to wonder: Would an AI like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment? Tay – a chatbot created for 18- to 24- year-olds in the U.S. for entertainment purposes – is our first attempt to answer this question./ As we developed Tay, we planned and implemented a lot of filtering and conducted extensive user studies with diverse user groups. We stress-tested Tay under a variety of conditions, specifically to make interacting with Tay a positive experience. Once we got comfortable with how Tay was interacting with users, we wanted to invite a broader group of people to engage with her. It’s through increased interaction where we expected to learn more and for the AI to get better and better./ The logical place for us to engage with a massive group of users was Twitter. Unfortunately, in the first 24 hours of coming online, a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay. Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack. As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images. We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time. We will take this lesson forward as well as those from our experiences in China, Japan and the U.S. Right now, we are hard at work addressing the specific vulnerability that was exposed by the attack on Tay. Looking ahead, we face some difficult – and yet exciting – research challenges in AI design. AI systems feed off of both positive and negative interactions with people. In that sense, the challenges are just as much social as they are technical. We will do everything possible to limit technical exploits but also know we cannot fully predict all possible human interactive misuses without learning from mistakes. To do AI right, one needs to iterate with many people and often in public forums. We must enter each one with great caution and ultimately learn and improve, step by step, and to do this without offending people in the process. We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.

The tweet announced the withdrawal of advertising from “Hannity” in response to comments made on his program last week that were viewed as controversial by many of our consumers. This is to provide you with full transparency on the situation, our lessons learned and our path forward./Like most consumer-oriented companies, Keurig’s media purchases are driven by delivery of ratings for our target consumer audience. We also have a defined set of programming guidelines to ensure we deliver our advertising in the right programming environment and protect our brand from objectionable content./ The fact is, our consumer demographics match well with live news programming, which is why we advertise on nearly all cable news channels, ranging from MSNBC to Fox to CNN, all of which will continue. However, given the dynamic nature of news, we always need to evaluate that programming environment on a real-time basis./The catalyst for the current situation was commentary made by Sean Hannity on his TV and radio programs last week, which sparked a significant number of consumer complaints directed to us as advertisers on his TV program. Hannity himself later apologized for his comments in his own tweet: “As I said on TV tonight, I apologize when I misspoke and was not totally clear earlier today.”/In most situations such as this one, we would “pause” our advertising on that particular program and reevaluate our go-forward strategy at a later date. That represents a prudent “business as usual” decision for us, as the protection of our brand is our foremost concern. However, the decision to publicly communicate our programming decision via our Twitter account was highly unusual. This gave the appearance of “taking sides” in an emotionally charged debate that escalated on Twitter and beyond over the weekend, which was not our intent. I want you to know the decision to communicate our short-term media actions on Twitter was done outside of company protocols. Clearly, this is an unacceptable situation that requires an overhaul of our issues response and external communications policies and the introduction of safeguards to ensure this never happens again. Our company and brand reputations are too valuable to be put at risk in this manner. The nature of social media and the internet news environment is that stories like this explode, and generally do not disappear quickly. Given the circumstances, we wanted to reach out and communicate with you directly so you understood our position and the protocols we have in place. I apologize for any negativity that you have experienced as a result of this situation and assure you that we will learn and improve going forward.

Recently there was an issue that affected some of our customers with AT&T 3G service for iPad resulting in the release of their customer e-mail addresses. I am writing to let you know that no other information was exposed and the matter has been resolved. We apologize for the incident and any inconvenience it may have caused. Rest assured, you can continue to use your AT&T 3G service on your iPad with confidence.
Here’s some additional detail:
On June 7 we learned that unauthorized computer “hackers” maliciously exploited a function designed to make your iPad log-in process faster by pre-populating an AT&T authentication page with the e-mail address you used to register your iPad for 3G service. The self-described hackers wrote software code to randomly generate numbers that mimicked serial numbers of the AT&T SIM card for iPad – called the integrated circuit card identification (ICC-ID) – and repeatedly queried an AT&T web address. When a number generated by the hackers matched an actual ICC-ID, the authentication page log-in screen was returned to the hackers with the e-mail address associated with the ICC-ID already populated on the log-in screen.
The hackers deliberately went to great efforts with a random program to extract possible ICC-IDs and capture customer e-mail addresses. They then put together a list of these e-mails and distributed it for their own publicity.
As soon as we became aware of this situation, we took swift action to prevent any further unauthorized exposure of customer email addresses. Within hours, AT&T disabled the mechanism that automatically populated the e-mail address. Now, the authentication page log-in screen requires the user to enter both their e-mail address and their password.
I want to assure you that the e-mail address and ICC-ID were the only information that was accessible. Your password, account information, the contents of your e-mail, and any other personal information were never at risk. The hackers never had access to AT&T communications or data networks, or your iPad. AT&T 3G service for other mobile devices was not affected.
While the attack was limited to e-mail address and ICC-ID data, we encourage you to be alert to scams that could attempt to use this information to obtain other data or send you unwanted email. You can learn more about phishing by visiting the AT&T website.
AT&T takes your privacy seriously and does not tolerate unauthorized access to its customers’ information or company websites. We will cooperate with law enforcement in any investigation of unauthorized system access and to prosecute violators to the fullest extent of the law.
AT&T acted quickly to protect your information – and we promise to keep working around the clock to keep your information safe. Thank you very much for your understanding, and for being an AT&T customer.

"41",41,"2017","Apple","AAPL","Slowing Older Phones","Public","Apple faced lawsuits after a report of the firm deliberately slow down older Iphone models when models come out",0,0,"0","11/15/2017","12/28/2017","A Message to Our Customers about iPhone Batteries and Performance
We’ve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize. There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we’re making.

First and foremost, we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades. Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.

How batteries age
All rechargeable batteries are consumable components that become less effective as they chemically age and their ability to hold a charge diminishes. Time and the number of times a battery has been charged are not the only factors in this chemical aging process.

Device use also affects the performance of a battery over its lifespan. For example, leaving or charging a battery in a hot environment can cause a battery to age faster. These are characteristics of battery chemistry, common to lithium-ion batteries across the industry.

A chemically aged battery also becomes less capable of delivering peak energy loads, especially in a low state of charge, which may result in a device unexpectedly shutting itself down in some situations.

To help customers learn more about iPhone’s rechargeable battery and the factors affecting its performance, we’ve posted a new support article, iPhone Battery and Performance.

It should go without saying that we think sudden, unexpected shutdowns are unacceptable. We don’t want any of our users to lose a call, miss taking a picture or have any other part of their iPhone experience interrupted if we can avoid it.

Preventing unexpected shutdowns
About a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.

Customer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.

Of course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one, iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard conditions.

Recent user feedback
Over the course of this fall, we began to receive feedback from some users who were seeing slower performance in certain situations. Based on our experience, we initially thought this was due to a combination of two factors: a normal, temporary performance impact when upgrading the operating system as iPhone installs new software and updates apps, and minor bugs in the initial release which have since been fixed.

We now believe that another contributor to these user experiences is the continued chemical aging of the batteries in older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, many of which are still running on their original batteries.

Addressing customer concerns
We’ve always wanted our customers to be able to use their iPhones as long as possible. We’re proud that Apple products are known for their durability, and for holding their value longer than our competitors’ devices.

To address our customers’ concerns, to recognize their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple’s intentions, we’ve decided to take the following steps:

Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29 — for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, available worldwide through December 2018. Details will be provided soon on apple.com.
Early in 2018, we will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.
As always, our team is working on ways to make the user experience even better, including improving how we manage performance and avoid unexpected shutdowns as batteries age.
At Apple, our customers’ trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support — and we will never forget that or take it for granted.",20,"(NYT) A New Phone Comes Out. Yours Slows Down. A Conspiracy?

joining us here we saw that on YouTube
this morning and couldn't help but want
to share it so thanks for coming we've
would love to answer your questions
today before we do I've got about just
15 minute quick presentation so maybe go
over some stuff in a more efficient
manner and then open it up for questions
sound all right great
well let me get started you know we're
not perfect we know that you know that
and phones aren't perfect either but we
want to make it make all of our users
happy if you don't know that about Apple
you don't know Apple we love making our
users happy that's what drives us to
make these products in the first place
so we're gonna talk about how we're
gonna do that today before we get into
that though I want to talk a little
about the problems and the data that
we've got that can help inform us about
what the problems really are so that we
can make sure we make all our users
happy so let's get started the iPhone 4
is perhaps the best product we've ever
made at Apple and we have sold well over
three million since we launched it three
weeks ago just three weeks ago and it's
been judged the number one smartphone in
a variety of publications these are just
a few wired and gadget PC world consumer
reports so people seem to like it more
importantly you
users seem to love it it already has the
highest customer satisfaction rating of
any iPhone ever and of any smartphone
out there so that's not bad in the first
three weeks however we started getting
some reports of people having issues
with the antenna system which is a very
advanced new antenna system and the
problems they were saying obviously
Gizmodo put their video on the web
people were touching x marks the spot
here and they were seeing a large drop
in bars and this has been since dubbed
antenna gate so we heard about this not
long after we started shipping just 22
days ago from today right it's not like
Apple's had its head in the sand for
three months on this guys it's been 22
days and you know Apple is an
engineering driven company we've got
some of the finest scientists and
engineers here in the world in the areas
that we need to create our products and
the way we work is we want to find out
what the real problem is before we start
to come up with solutions and so we've
been working our butts off for the last
22 days to understand what the real
issues are here so that we can come up
with real solutions and today we want to
share with you what we've learned so
let's go right to the data antenna gate
doesn't seem like a good idea if you can
touch your phone or in particular grip
your phone in a certain way and the bars
go way down that doesn't seem like a
good thing well it turns out it's
certainly not unique to the iPhone 4
that was one of the first things we
learned you could go on YouTube and see
videos of Nokia phones and Motorola
phones and other phones doing the same
thing nobody'd ever looked at him much
before
and frankly we didn't trust him either
so we did our own testing we have
extremely sophisticated testing here and
let me just show you an example of some
other smart phones so we're gonna start
off with some very credible phones these
are all good phones there's nothing
wrong with them the first is the
BlackBerry Bold 9700 made by RIM this is
perhaps the most popular phone popular
smartphone in business so let's take a
look at what happens when you hold it in
a totally normal way so you can see the
bars right there it's got five bars and
we're gonna grip it like you might
easily grip it to make a phone call and
you'll see the bars go down to one
fairly rapidly and you ungroup it and
the bars go back up to five pretty much
identical to the videos on the web about
the iPhone 4 so there's the BlackBerry
Bold by bars to one bar different people
grip phones in different ways but you
can imagine that's pretty popular way to
grip that phone next the HTC Droid
heiress it's an Android phone let's take
a look at it starts off with four bars
they only have four bars and the time it
takes for the bars to go down is
dictated by their algorithm the signal
goes down right away but the algorithm
sometimes delays it to make sure it's
not just a temporary glitch as to not
confuse the user so it goes down to zero
bars and then when you take your hand
away from wherever their antenna weak
spot is it goes back up essentially to
four bars there so again the HTC Droid
heiress same behavior four bars to zero
bars samsung omnia - the windows mobile
phone let's take a look at it it's got
four bars to start
we grip it no not unusual way this one I
believe they have a long history sis and
their algorithm so it takes a minute or
so to drop the bars but again the signal
strength dropped immediately and the
display goes dark quickly they're trying
to save battery life
again the signal is already down to I
believe one bar but they're just taking
their time to show it to make sure
they're not making a mistake none of
this is standardized by the way
manufacturers come up with their own
delays and and so again you'll see it go
back up I think they go back up a little
faster than they go down so we get back
to four bars here pretty quickly now
these phones
so we could have gone on and on and had
another five or six phones to show you
they most smartphones behaved exactly
the same way
now these phones were all tested in
areas of relatively weak signal strength
just like people have been testing the
iPhone 4 and you can see that the bars
go from five to one four two zero four
to one this is life in the smartphone
world phones aren't perfect and it's a
challenge for the whole industry and
we're all doing the best we can but
every phone has weak spots most every
smartphone we've tested behaves just
like this when it's in a relatively weak
signal area and you grip it in a certain
way that's not unusual
now we're not perfect we made it very
visible with a little help from our
friends on certain websites
what we did was x marks the spot we went
to a lot of trouble to put this really
beautiful line in the stainless steel to
say here's where you touch it everybody
you know might as well just could have
just put a you know wave the little red
flag right there and we get incorrect
bars so that when it did drop the drop
look far more catastrophic than in
reality it was you thought you were
dropping from five bars to one bar when
in reality you were probably dropping
from two or three bars to one bar but we
screwed up on our algorithm by the way
some of these other phones might be
being a little too liberal with their
algorithms too but that's their that's
their choice our choice is to put the
correct algorithm in which we've just
done with a release we sent out
yesterday and hopefully that will give
people a better indication of the signal
strength that they're in their bars will
still drop by a bar to when they put
their finger or they grip that place and
just just grip the phone in just the
right place and again all smartphones
seem to do that we haven't figured out a
way around the laws of physics
yet so we do a lot of testing we've got
an extremely sophisticated antenna lab
this is one of the pieces of equipment
somebody will sit there and rotate
around inside this these are all
antennas looking at the antenna
reception from every angle again fully
automated testing where we're testing
the reception in free space you know
here's our biggest room right here again
you have to build these rooms because if
you don't shield what you're testing
from all of the outside interference you
don't get accurate tests and you can't
put your equipment in the room either
the equipment's got to all be remote it
outside the room now this is a
state-of-the-art antenna test facility
we have 17 anechoic chambers these
things are not cheap we've invested over
a hundred million dollars in our antenna
testing facilities over the last five
years we have 18 PhD scientists and
engineers on our state a much larger
staff but 18 PhD scientists and
engineers working in this area and they
do some very advanced antenna design and
so the iPhone antenna went through all
of this we tested it we knew that if you
gripped it in a certain way the bars are
going to go down a little bit just like
every smartphone we didn't think it'd be
a big problem because every smartphone
has this issue so phones aren't perfect
and it's a challenge for the entire
industry and we're hoping to make some
contributions to this in future years as
a matter of fact we think we've started
with this antenna which is a more
advanced antenna than ever has shipped
on a smartphone before people are
reporting better reception with this
antenna than they've ever seen with
their smartphones before so what have we
learned the first thing we've learned is
smartphones have weak spots this is not
unique to iPhone 4 this is a property of
smart
phones they have weak spots you can grab
them in the course of normal use and
they're all different but you will you
will drop reception next some really
interesting data from Apple care as you
know we get very high marks in terms of
customer service our customer service
program is called Apple care whenever
anyone calls in for a problem in
addition to solving their problem
they're logged we look at the statistics
and we've got the statistics on Apple
care and we asked ourselves what's the
percent of all iPhone 4 users who have
called Apple care about issues relating
anything about the antenna or reception
or anything even near antenna or
reception in other words if you read all
these articles out there you would have
thought Jesus at least half our
customers must have called in to
complain or ask questions or be angry
right so what percent of the iPhone
users have called Apple care hard data
1/2 of 1% 1/2 of 1% 0.55 percent this
data is just a few days old 0.55 percent
historically for us this is not a large
number so this this doesn't really jive
with what you read about this problem
let's keep going so smart phones have
weaknesses in Apple care about 1/2 a
percent of our iPhone you four users
have called in about problems related to
reception antennas etc even after
reading all of these articles out there
0.55 percent the third return rates
like Apple 18t who is the largest
reseller of iPhones in the world has a
if you will buyer's remorse return
period and people return phones for all
sorts of reasons the reception in their
area isn't what they'd hoped they try it
out they just don't like it the antenna
doesn't work for them when they grip it
a certain way whatever it is no
questions asked they can return a phone
just like it to Apple and so what are
the return rates through our largest
reseller of iPhone 4s well what we're
gonna do is compare it to iPhone 3GS
because iPhone 3GS has been the
best-selling smartphone in history it's
the gold standard so in the early days
of iPhone 3GS a year ago 18 thieves
return rates were 6% which is below the
smartphone average and everybody was
pretty happy about that what are they
for the iPhone 4 again you go online and
you read all these articles about it and
you think it must be G's at least half
the people must be returning their
phones right it's pretty serious well
we've got the data now and the hard data
says it's 1.7 percent it is less than a
third of the return rates for the iPhone
3GS
hard data just a few days old so smart
phones have weak spots about 1/2 of 1%
of all iPhone owners have called Apple
care about anything related to antennas
and reception and the returns at our
largest iPhone 4 reseller are a third of
what they were for a phone that was
regarded as spectacular a year ago
okay pretty interesting one more up data
point AT&T; has given us the early call
drop rate information just three days
ago they obviously run the net a very
sophisticated network they do a great
job and they log call drops that helps
them improve their network and so we
can't give out the absolute call drop
data that's very confidential and
proprietary to them for competitive
reasons they don't want to give it out
and I totally agree with them but
they're gonna let us release the Delta
to the iPhone 3GS so how is the call
drops how am i phone called how the call
drops on iphone 4 compared to call drops
on iphone 3gs during its early period a
year ago how many additional calls are
dropped for every hundred calls you make
on an iPhone 4 compared to an iPhone 3GS
and I can tell you since we are being
totally transparent but even though we
believe the iPhone 4 is antenna is
superior to that of the iPhone 3GS I
must report to you that the iPhone 4
drops more calls per hundred than the
iPhone 3GS that's what the data says we
got it three days ago so how many more
calls per hundred does the iphone 4 drop
than the iPhone 3GS again listening to
antenna gate on the web you would think
wow it must be dropping half the calls
it must be dropping at least 50 more
calls per hundred or 25 more calls per
hundred right wouldn't you expect that
this is the hard data
the iPhone four drops less than one
additional call per hundred more than
the iPhone 3GS less than one additional
call four hundred now even less than one
is too much for us we were trying to
find out why we want to drive this lower
than the 3GS but this does put it in
perspective so I have my own pet theory
on this which we have no proof of but
I'll give it to you anyway when the
iPhone 3GS came out we did not change
the design from the iPhone 3 and there
was a healthy market of cases for the
iPhone 3G there were already in stores
that fit the 3GS perfectly since the
design didn't change and in our stores
80% of the iPhone 3GS users walked out
with a case iPhone 4 has a radically new
design none of the old cases fit since
we didn't show it to anybody none of the
new cases are ready and we can't make
enough of our bumper cases and so in our
stores about 20% of the people are going
out with a case and I think that has
something to do with this disparity but
who knows we're gonna track it down but
again zooming out less than one
additional call drop 400 calls over the
iPhone 3GS so if you put these four
things together smart phones have weak
spots most every smartphone we've tested
exhibits the identical behavior if
grabbed in a reasonable way as the
videos you've all seen on the web of the
iPhone 4 let around 1/2 of 1% of iPhone
owners have called Apple care
in relation to reception and antenna
issues only 0.55 percent of all iPhone
owners have called an extremely low
number the return rates for iPhone 4 are
running one third of those for the
iPhone 3GS a year ago and the iPhone 4
drops less than one more call per
hundred than the iPhone 3GS now when we
look at this data when our engineers and
scientists look at this data it's very
hard to escape the conclusion that there
is a problem but that that problem is
affecting a very small percentage of
users
I myself have gotten somewhere over
5,000 emails from users telling me how
their iPhone 4 works perfectly and they
can't figure out what all of this is
about so we think there's a problem but
we think it's affecting a small
percentage of users and we think some of
that problem is inherent in most every
smartphone but having said this we care
about every user and we're not gonna
stop until every one of those is happy
but I think it's important to understand
the scope of this problem because what
the data says lead you to the conclusion
that this has been blown so out of
proportion that it's it's incredible I
know it's fun to have a story but it's
less fun when you're on the other end of
it
so we care about every user so let me
tell you what we're gonna do the first
thing we did yesterday we released iOS
version 4.1 that is now out people are
updating it it fixes the wrong formula
that
used to calculate how many bars to put
up for a given signal strength and there
was a nasty exchange bug in there that a
lot of our corporate customers are
hitting and that's fixed as well so
those bugs are fixed iOS fours out 4.1
is out and we recommend that every
iPhone owner update to it secondly a lot
of people have told us the bumper solves
the signal strength problem
Consumer Reports this the latest one
this week we've heard it from a lot of
people why don't you just give everybody
a case ok great let's give everybody a
case we've got our bumper case here but
we want to give everybody a free case
every iPhone user is going to get a free
case one for every iPhone 4 if you've
already bought one we'll give you a full
refund for a bumper and we're gonna do
this for every iPhone 4 purchase through
September 30th will re-examine this in
September and decide whether to keep
going or maybe we'll have a better idea
but at least through September 30th a
free case for every iPhone 4 and if you
bought a bumper we'll give you a full
refund
now everything in life is more
complicated than it seems on the surface
we're gonna send you a free case we
can't make enough bumpers right we're
planning on selling them and making a
certain percentage and we have the
tooling done if we're gonna try to give
a bumper to everyone we no way we can
make enough in the quarter so what we're
gonna do is source some other cases and
give users a choice of cases and they'll
be able to pick one and you can apply on
our website starting late next week
it'll take us about a week to get this
all up pick a case zoom we'll send it
off to you that's simple so a free case
for every iPhone 4 user simple and if
you're still not happy before or after
you get a free case as we've said you
can bring your iPhone 4 back undamaged
within 30 days
for a full refund we've waived any
restocking fees anything full refund so
we are gonna take care of everyone we
want every user to be happy and if we
can't make them happy
we'll give them a full refund that make
sense so I'm

straight up we made some mistakes we

well these mistakes have to do with the

sometimes mistakes are made they're

Within days, commentators started to question the veracity of our narrative. Then, when The Washington Post uncovered details suggesting that the assault could not have taken place the way we described it, the truth of the story became a subject of national controversy.

As we asked ourselves how we could have gotten the story wrong, we decided the only responsible and credible thing to do was to ask someone from outside the magazine to investigate any lapses in reporting, editing and fact-checking behind the story. We reached out to Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter himself, who accepted our offer. We agreed that we would cooperate fully, that he and his team could take as much time as they needed and write whatever they wanted. They would receive no payment, and we promised to publish their report in full. (A condensed version of the report will appear in the next issue of the magazine, out April 8th.)

This report was painful reading, to me personally and to all of us at Rolling Stone. It is also, in its own way, a fascinating document ­— a piece of journalism, as Coll describes it, about a failure of journalism. With its publication, we are officially retracting 'A Rape on Campus.' We are also committing ourselves to a series of recommendations about journalistic practices that are spelled out in the report. We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students. Sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses, and it is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward. It saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings.

So it’s with real remorse–and embarrassment–that one of our employees fell for a phishing scam and revealed some payroll information about our employees. The good news is that our servers were not breached, and our users’ data was totally unaffected by this. The bad news is that a number of our employees have now had their identity compromised. And for that, we’re just impossibly sorry.

Here’s what happened: Last Friday, Snapchat’s payroll department was targeted by an isolated email phishing scam in which a scammer impersonated our Chief Executive Officer and asked for employee payroll information. Unfortunately, the phishing email wasn’t recognized for what it was–a scam–and payroll information about some current and former employees was disclosed externally. To be perfectly clear though: None of our internal systems were breached, and no user information was accessed.
Needless to say, we responded swiftly and aggressively. Within four hours of this incident, we confirmed that the phishing attack was an isolated incident and reported it to the FBI. We began sorting through which employees–current and past–may have been affected. And we have since contacted the affected employees and have offered them two years of free identity-theft insurance and monitoring.
When something like this happens, all you can do is own up to your mistake, take care of the people affected, and learn from what went wrong. To make good on that last point, we will redouble our already rigorous training programs around privacy and security in the coming weeks. Our hope is that we never have to write a blog post like this again.

I wish I could claim that it’s a one off situation and we’ll do better the next time – but I’ll be honest, we’ve been screwing up on anticipating demand for a long time – for the past couple of years, every time we launch a new product, demand just far outstrips the supply.  We’ve tried different things – we’ve tried doubling tripling quadrupling manufacturing capacity - we've ramped back to phasing in launches by geography (even now – Blade is only limited to the US but still we can’t meet the demand) – we’ve pushed back launch dates – and still we end up disappointing our customers (and in many cases – we end up pissing them off).

Following GII’s announcement, GII and the potentially affected Goodwill members engaged a third-party forensic expert to conduct an extensive investigation. GII and its members have also been working closely with federal law enforcement authorities and coordinating with the payment card brands to determine the facts.

The forensic investigation has confirmed that a third-party vendor’s systems were attacked by malware, enabling criminals to access some payment card data of a number of the vendor’s customers. The impacted Goodwill members used the same affected third-party vendor to process credit card payments. Each of the impacted Goodwill members took immediate action to ensure that the malware found on the third-party vendor’s systems no longer presents a threat to individuals shopping at the affected Goodwill members’ stores.

Based on the investigation, GII and its members have determined the following:

        Twenty Goodwill members (representing about 10 percent of all stores) that use the same affected third-party vendor were impacted.
        The investigation found no evidence of malware on any internal Goodwill systems.
        The third-party vendor’s affected systems contained payment card information, such as names, payment card numbers, and expiration dates of certain Goodwill members’ customers. There is no evidence that other customer personal information, such as addresses or PINs, was affected by this issue.
        The malware attack affected the third-party vendor’s systems intermittently between February 10, 2013, and August 14, 2014. Some stores experienced shorter periods of impact. A list of the Goodwill members’ store locations that used the affected vendor during the relevant time period is available on GII’s website at 
http://www.goodwill.org/payment-card-notice.
        Goodwill members have received a very limited number of reports from the payment card brands of fraudulent use of payment cards connected to Goodwill members’ stores. We continue to take this matter very seriously. We took immediate steps to address this issue, and we are providing extensive support to the affected Goodwill members in their efforts to prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future,” said Jim Gibbons, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International. “We realize a data security compromise is an issue that every retailer and consumer needs to be aware of today, and we are working diligently to prevent this type of unfortunate situation from happening again. Goodwill’s mission is to provide job training for people with disabilities and disadvantages. We provide this service to millions of people each year. They, our shoppers and our donors, are our first priority.

The impacted Goodwill members used the same affected third-party vendor to process credit card payments. Each of the impacted Goodwill members took immediate action to ensure that the malware found on the third-party vendor’s systems no longer presents a threat to individuals shopping at the affected Goodwill members’ stores.
Based on the investigation, GII and its members have determined the following:
        Twenty Goodwill members (representing about 10 percent of all stores) that use the same affected third-party vendor were impacted.
        The investigation found no evidence of malware on any internal Goodwill systems.
        The third-party vendor’s affected systems contained payment card information, such as names, payment card numbers, and expiration dates of certain Goodwill members’ customers. There is no evidence that other customer personal information, such as addresses or PINs, was affected by this issue.
        The malware attack affected the third-party vendor’s systems intermittently between February 10, 2013, and August 14, 2014. Some stores experienced shorter periods of impact. A list of the Goodwill members’ store locations that used the affected vendor during the relevant time period is available on GII’s website at 
http://www.goodwill.org/payment-card-notice.
        Goodwill members have received a very limited number of reports from the payment card brands of fraudulent use of payment cards connected to Goodwill members’ stores. We continue to take this matter very seriously. We took immediate steps to address this issue, and we are providing extensive support to the affected Goodwill members in their efforts to prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future,” said Jim Gibbons, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries International. “We realize a data security compromise is an issue that every retailer and consumer needs to be aware of today, and we are working diligently to prevent this type of unfortunate situation from happening again. Goodwill’s mission is to provide job training for people with disabilities and disadvantages. We provide this service to millions of people each year. They, our shoppers and our donors, are our first priority.

face watching the tape as well this is a
hard time for you guys it's a really
tough time but first I have to say I'm
sorry for the people who got sick
they're having a tough time and I
feel terrible about that and we're doing
a lot to rectify this and to make sure
that this doesn't happen again let's
start in Boston we'll work our way back
to the Pacific Northwest the norovirus
is what's sickened these people 120
people it seems up in Boston the
restaurant is closed down they've been
issued some violations the cleanup is
underway are you convinced that you've
contained this now that more people
won't report being sick well so in
regard to the e.coli it you know there
was one particular period of time from
from mid-october until early November
that that appeared that that's when the
outbreak occurred and the reporting of
the illnesses stat came out over a long
period of time so you're saying in
Boston you could have more cases
reported well it with the norovirus
probably you know we have heard that
this is the this is the extent of it but
it's a it's a very it's a disease that
that is very easily passed and so it
spreads very very quickly from from
person to person and you convinced when
you reopen that store and brighten up
near Boston that that people will not be
getting sick if they go back to eat well
when we reopen the restaurant will be
completely sanitized and every
single employee will have been tested
and assured that they do not have
norovirus now let's go back to the
Pacific Northwest coli outbreak there
started in early November 43 stores shut
down dozens of people got sick it's my
understanding that after weeks of
investigating this the FDA has not found
an exact source of that e.coli bacteria
it’s true and we've had
teams looking at this we closed
our restaurants out of an abundance of
caution and tested all the ingredients
surfaces thousands and thousands of
tests mat and they all came back
negative for e.coli and so and so
if there's a silver lining in this it is
that we have looked at at every single
ingredient that we use at Chipotle we
use 64 ingredients that we bring in so
from farm through the distribution
network how we prepare the food how we
cook the food and how we serve the food
we've had a team of epidemiologists and
food safety experts to raise our
standards from from the already
industry norms that fit a silver lining
and I think it might be troubling
because if you can't identify the source
how do you go about eliminating it in
the future well fortunately what got people
sick was no longer in the system by the
time that even showed symptoms and so
and so unfortunately, you'll not find
that but what hit but the silver lining
comment is that it has caused us to
put in place practices that our
epidemiologist expert dr. salmon Porter
says will put us 10 to 15 years ahead of
industry norms and and and I believe
this will be the safest restaurant to
eat at stock prices top double digits
since this began in in early November
that's a big loss on the bottom line two
parts to this first of all financially
can the company recover well certainly
but that's not what we're thinking about
now we're thinking about the safety and
and and and quality of our ingredients
to put in place practices that will not
enable this to happen again
practices that are so far above industry
norms today we will be the safest place
to eat and that is our commitment much
like food with integrity to bring the
very best ingredients to to fast food
we're now saying we have practices that
will make it the safest place to be and
finally real quickly if you can there
are critics who say mr. elves that this
company started with a great idea and
then grew too fast that it just took off
at a at a rate where you couldn't keep
control of things like sourcing and
quality control and even things that
would affect the public health is there
some merit to that claim I don't think
so because if you if you look at the
quality of our ingredients over time
we've made great strides in sourcing
better quality food meats without
growth hormones more organics more local
and sustainably raised foods this was a
very unfortunate incident and I'm deeply
sorry this happened but but the
procedures were putting in place today
are so above industry norms that were
that we are going to be the safest place
to eat

"85",85,"2010","Apple","AAPL","","","",NA,NA,"0","","","Dear iPhone 4 Users,
The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in Apple’s history. It has been judged by reviewers around the world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them. Here is what we have learned.
To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of having a faulty antenna design.
At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our own experience and testing. What can explain all of this?
We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it is both simple and surprising.
Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying as few as 2 bars. Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength, but they don’t know it because we are erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place.
To fix this, we are adopting AT&T’s recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the iPhone’s bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a given area. We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so they will be easier to see.
We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been present since the original iPhone, this software update will also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G.
We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the results are the same— the iPhone 4’s wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused.
As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.
We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do.
Thank you for your patience and support.

We should have responded faster, communicated more sensitively, and taken more decisive action to make sure she felt safe and secure. But we weren’t prepared for the crisis and we dropped the ball. Now we’re dealing with the consequences. In working with the San Francisco Police Department, we are happy to say a suspect is now in custody. Even so, we realize that we have disappointed the community. To EJ, and all the other hosts who have had bad experiences, we know you deserve better from us.
We want to make it right. On August 15th, we will be implementing a $50,000 Airbnb Guarantee, protecting the property of hosts from damage by Airbnb guests who book reservations through our website. We will extend this program to EJ and any other hosts who may have reported such property damage while renting on Airbnb in the past.
We’ve built this company by listening to our community. Guided by your feedback, we have iterated to become safer and more secure. Our job’s not done yet; we’re still evolving. In the wake of these recent events, we’ve heard an uproar from people, both inside and outside our community. Know that we were closely listening.",-10,"(NYT) After Horror Stories, Airbnb Unveils New Policies

Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyber attackers. Very recently, Adobe’s security team discovered sophisticated attacks on our network, involving the illegal access of customer information as well as source code for numerous Adobe products. We believe these attacks may be related.

Our investigation currently indicates that the attackers accessed Adobe customer IDs and encrypted passwords on our systems. We also believe the attackers removed from our systems certain information relating to 2.9 million Adobe customers, including customer names, encrypted credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates, and other information relating to customer orders. At this time, we do not believe the attackers removed decrypted credit or debit card numbers from our systems. We deeply regret that this incident occurred. We’re working diligently internally, as well as with external partners and law enforcement, to address the incident. We’re taking the following steps:

As a precaution, we are resetting relevant customer passwords to help prevent unauthorized access to Adobe ID accounts. If your user ID and password were involved, you will receive an email notification from us with information on how to change your password. We also recommend that you change your passwords on any website where you may have used the same user ID and password.
We are in the process of notifying customers whose credit or debit card information we believe to be involved in the incident. If your information was involved, you will receive a notification letter from us with additional information on steps you can take to help protect yourself against potential misuse of personal information about you. Adobe is also offering customers, whose credit or debit card information was involved, the option of enrolling in a one-year complimentary credit monitoring membership where available.
We have notified the banks processing customer payments for Adobe, so that they can work with the payment card companies and card-issuing banks to help protect customers’ accounts.
We have contacted federal law enforcement and are assisting in their investigation.
We are also investigating the illegal access to source code of numerous Adobe products. Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident. For more information, please see the blog post here.

We value the trust of our customers. We will work aggressively to prevent these types of events from occurring in the future. Again, we deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause you. If you would like additional information, please refer to Adobe’s Customer Support page.
